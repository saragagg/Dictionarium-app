                you were searching for a specific form of the word e.g., noun,
                verb, adjective, try searching for the base form or vice versa.

                you're looking for is not found, it might have synonyms that we
                do have in our dictionary. Search for a similar word that
                conveys the same meaning.

                related terms. Try searching for broader categories that might
                include the word you need.
